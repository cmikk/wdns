wdns (0.5)

  * Update copyright and license statements as a result of the transition from
    Internet Systems Consortium to Farsight Security.

  * Escape literal backslashes when converting domain names or record data to
    presentation format.

  * Add a spec file for building on RPM systems, based on a spec file
    contributed by John Heidemann.

  * Replace the "librsf" submodule with the "libmy" subtree.

  * Correct the "Name:" field in the libwdns.pc file.

  * Make it possible to build with "make" rather than "gmake" on FreeBSD by
    generating libwdns.pc from the configure script rather than the Makefile.

  * Install the libwdns.pc file into the right directory on FreeBSD systems
    where pkg-config has been modified to read from a "libdata" directory.
